*Preface:* I later found out that wine caps are generally grown in outdoor wood chip beds. According to the [North Spore substrate compatibility guide](https://northspore.com/pages/mushroom-substrate-compatibility-guide), wine caps in a monotub is an experimental procedure.

### Contaminant: Trichoderma

This is a picture of a contaminated [Boomr Bag](https://northspore.com/collections/sterile-substrates/products/boomr-bag-manure-based-sterile-substrate-5lb). Notice the break in the plastic along the seal. I am fairly sure I did this by tossing the box onto the floor when they arrived.

I did not put this bag into a monotub. Instead, I put the *other* broken one (which didn't have any visible growth) into one of the tubs. The other tub was done with three uncontaminated bags, but got infected anyway. The deployment was done without the [flow hood]({filename}laminar-flow-hood-build.md), and were near each other during colonization. It's easy to see why both would have gotten infected. A rather expensive mistake.

Here are the tubs before they were emptied into the compost pile.

Not all was lost, however. The day after dumping the tubs, I poured 10 MYA plates. The day after that, I went outside and grabbed a couple of the red wheat berries from the compost, and dropped them onto a plate. A while after that, I isolated some mycelium from this plate and put it on a clean one. This second plate was eventually fully colonized with healthy growth. Strain rescued!
