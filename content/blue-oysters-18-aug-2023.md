Second flush of a [blue oyster fruiting block](https://northspore.com/collections/mushroom-fruiting-block-kits/products/blue-oyster-fruiting-block) in the [automated enclosure]({filename}enclosure-automation.md).

Harvested about 9 hours too late. Still too much CO<sub>2</sub>, they have fuzzy feet. Enclosure v2 will solve this problem with a second FAE fan.
